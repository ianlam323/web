<p>The floor map indicates the change in central library 20 years from now.</p>

<p>The libary has turned into a more organised and modernised library, with more machinearies such as self-service machines and computer installed.</p>

<p>The library 20 years ago once had an area for CDs, videos and computer games but it has changed into a computer room locating at the bottom left hand corner of the 
library. The children's area where children's books were stored has been relocated to the original CD area. Two sofas are placed so that storytelling evens can 
be hosted. The old children's area were redesigned to a lecture room with no books stored. THe adult non-fiction books and fiction books has switched places so now 
the fiction books are on the right hand side and non-fiction on the left hand side of the open area. </p>

<p>The tables and chairs has been demolished and now left with an open space. A new caf√© has been built to replace the enquiry desk. Currently, the information desk 
has moved to the open area, where self-service machines are also implimented. A new door has been built which is located next to the entrance.</p>
