<p>The map plans compares the change in the terminal for Southwest Airport currently and after development.</p>

<p>Overall, the airport is more commertialised with more facilities such as ATM, Sky train and Car hire being built. The airport also has a pier area expansion 
with more gates being built. This allows a higher airport capacity annually.</p>

<p>Firstly for the departures hall, the check in counter and café has been relocated after the development, so that the check in counter will be in the café's 
original location. The bag drop area will replace the original check in area. Afer immigration and security check, there will be new shops built. A sky train 
will also be built to replace the old walkway for passengers whos gate is at 4-16. There will also be a gate number reallocation, so that the current gate 6-8 
will be numbered 16-18 in the future.</p>

<p>Currently, the arrivals hall is completly empty, and after development, a brand new café will be built near the passport control and customs. An additional 
ATM machine will be built next to the café and a car hire area will be expaned so that people can get taxis.</p>
