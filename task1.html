<p>The picture indicates the process for making sugar from sugar cane. </p>
<p>Overall, there are 7 steps in order to make sugar out of its raw material, sugar cane. </p>
<p>Firstly, farrmers need to grow sugar canes in their farmland. This process take approximatly 2-3 years. Then, farmers either harvest the sugar canes using machine or by human labour. The harvested sugar canes will be sent to factories for further processing.</p>
<p>Afterwards, sugar canes will be crushed into juice using a blender and the juice will be purified using a limestone filter. Then, the juice will be heated and boiled into syrup. A centrifuger will spin and the soild sugar will be seperated from the syrup, leaving the solid for the final step. Lastly, the sugar will be dried and cooled so that pure sugar will be formed.</p>
