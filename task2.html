Plan: <br>
Stay <br>
- Different country have different system eg: Healthcare system <br>
- There will be a loss in professionals <br>
Leave <br>
- Freedom to go to where they want, if their family is in their original country... <br>
- All have similar skills, it only takes short period of time for them to be trained in a new place <br>
<br>

<p>Some people around the world believe well trained career such as physitians and architechtures must stay in the country which they were trained in but some believe they should have the right to work in any other country if they wish to. Countries obviously would prefer their trained labour to stay as some countries are lacking trained professionals. On the other hand, everyone should have their right in to choose where they want to work in, and should not be limited in staying in a certain place.</p>
<p>Firstly, different countries would have differences in their professional system. An example is the healthcare system in United Kingdom versus Hong Kong's. The UK healthcare system is National Healthcare System while Hong Kong has its own public healthcare system. If doctor works in the NHS suddently wish to swich to Hong Kong to work, there might be problems such as different working hours, lack of resources and differenet amount of workload. This might stress doctors and they might find themselves in trobble while they are switching countries. On top of that, countries which trains the professions might result in a loss in labour. A classic example is the large proportion of people who trains in UK and will get back to their country to work. In a long run, the country might result in a lack in professionals which will slow down the economic development. Therefore in a macroeconomics view, people would like trained professionals to stay in where they did their training.</p>
<p>However, some people argue that everyone should have the basic human right to work or go wherever they want. If a person is limited to a place where their family is not with them, it would violate their human rights. Although the healthcare system around the world migth differ, their skills which they got from training are highly similar. In other words, it will only take a short period of time to adapt to the new envirioment as doctors are still doing their job, diagnosing patient. Therefore their skill will not be wasted. </p>
<p>All in all, everyone should have their right in choosing where they would like to stay for work. There might be some minor issues when there is a change in enviroment, untilmatly it would benefit professionals as a whole.</p>
