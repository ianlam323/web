Plan: <br>
Stay <br>
- Different country have different system eg: Healthcare system <br>
- There will be a loss in professionals <br>
Leave <br>
- Freedom to go to where they want, if their family is in their original country... <br>
- All have similar skills, it only takes short period of time for them to be trained in a new place <br>

<p>Some people around the world thinks that well trained career such as physitians and architechtures must stay in the country which they were trained in but some believe they should have the right to work in any other country if they wish to. Countries obviously would prefer their trained labour to stay in the country as some countries are lacking doctors. On the other hand, everyone should have their right in to choose where they want to work in, and should no be limited in staying in a certain place.</p>
