Plan: <br>
Stay <br>
- Different country have different system eg: Healthcare system <br>
- There will be a loss in professionals <br>
Leave <br>
- Freedom to go to where they want, if their family is in their original country... <br>
- All have similar skills, it only takes short period of time for them to be trained in a new place <br>
<br>

<p>Some people around the world thinks that well trained career such as physitians and architechtures must stay in the country which they were trained in but some believe they should have the right to work in any other country if they wish to. Countries obviously would prefer their trained labour to stay in the country as some countries are lacking doctors. On the other hand, everyone should have their right in to choose where they want to work in, and should no be limited in staying in a certain place.</p>
<p>Firstly, different countries would have differences in their system. An example is the healthcare system in United Kingdom and Hong Kong. The UK healthcare system is called National Healthcare System while Hong Kong has its own public healthcare system. If doctors working in NHS suddently wish to swich to Hong Kong to work in, there might be a problems such as different working hours, lack of resources and differenet amount of workload. This migth stress doctors and they might find themselves in trobble when they are switching countries. On top of that, countries which trains the professions might result in a loss in labour. As there is a large proportion of people who like to train in UK and get back to their country to work, in a long run, the country might result in a lack in professionals which will slow down the economic development. Therefore in a macroeconomics view, people would like trained professionals to stay in where they did their training.</p>
<p>However, some people argue that everyone should have the basic human right to work or go wherever they want. If a person is limited to a place where their family is not with them, it would violate their human rights. Although the healthcare system around the world migth be different, their skills in their professions are highly similar. In other words, it takes a short period of time for them to adapt to the envirioment as doctors are still diagnosing patient. Therefore their skill will not be wasted. </p>
<p>All in all, everyone should have their right in choosing where they would like to stay for work. There might be some minor issues when there is a change in enviroment, untilmatly it would benefit them as a whole.</p>
