Planning: <br>
Positive <br>
- Air quality in the countryside is better <br>
- Less noise pollution <br>
- For people who want cleaner air, they can choose to live in countryside <br>
Negative <br>
- City is more crowded -> More time for travelling -> More traffic jam <br>
- Not enough space for living -> ex HK -> Which requires removing trees to build house <br>


<p>In a lot of countries around the world, people tend to prefer living in city center instead of the countryside. This leads to a decrease in the number of people 
living in rural area. On one hand, this would result in a better environment and better air quality in the countryside, but on the other hand, the city center would be 
more polluted.</p>

<p>Regarding the positive development on this issue, people living in the countryside would have a better living environment. The air quality would be 
better than before as less people are taking transports, which leads to less air pollution. Also, there will be less trafic jams so that the noise pollution 
would also be less. People living in these rural area will enjoy a better living environment. This change would benefit them ultlimately. </p>

<p>However, more people moving to city center means that the city is more crowded. People will need to spend more time on travelling as the transport is 
buzzier than normal. For example, in the UK where public transports are always taken, having more people waiting for buses to arrive might mean 
more time is spent to arrive at a certain destination. Also, if there are more cars on the road, there will be more traffic jam and once again more time 
is spent for travelling. Moreover, if the city does not have enough space for the capacity in living, more houses will be built, and at the same time 
plants and trees might be taken down for building house. This would turn the city into a less enivornmentally friendly place.</p>

<p>All in all, more people moving to cities would lead to a negative effect. As more spaces will be polluted and overall have a negative environment cost. 
Therefore, when a city is overpopulated, the cost will exceed the benefits.</p>
